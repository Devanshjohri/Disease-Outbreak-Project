# Disease-Outbreak-Project
This application is a user-friendly web interface for predicting the likelihood of three major diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. It leverages machine learning models trained on relevant datasets to provide health predictions based on user input.

# Features
1. Diabetes Prediction:
* Input parameters: Number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
* Model output: Predicts whether the individual is diabetic or not.

2. Heart Disease Prediction:
* Input parameters: Age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and more.
* Model output: Predicts the presence or absence of heart disease.

3. Parkinson's Disease Prediction:
* Input parameters: A range of vocal metrics (e.g., MDVP features, jitter, shimmer, NHR, etc.).
* Model output: Predicts whether the individual has Parkinson's disease.

# Technologies Used
* Framework: Streamlit
* Language: Python
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
* Models: Pre-trained models loaded via pickle.
